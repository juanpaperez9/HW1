**any questions or clarifications you would like to have asked of the client who needs this code**

Some questions I would like to ask the client could be like:
What specific functionalities would you like to see for this weapon database feature?
Are there any specific requirements or constraints that need to be considered during development?



**any design decisions or assumptions you made in order to write the code**

So before starting writing the code I breakdown the problem to see what things I needed to have
to do address the problem.
First I needed a database to store the weapons so I defined the datastructure that in this case
I used a HashMap to store the weapons and corresponding strengths.
I created a class called weaponDatabase and then add some functions like addWeapon, getWeaponStrength and 
ListAllWeapons. Then I needed to organize the user interface. I created a scanner to allow user
interaction.
